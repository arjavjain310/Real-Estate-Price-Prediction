# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project is a machine learning web application that predicts house prices in Bangalore using a Kaggle dataset. The end-to-end pipeline covers everything from data preprocessing to model deployment, with an interactive UI for users to test predictions.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:

1.)Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed raw housing data
Handled missing values and categorical variables
Performed outlier detection to improve model accuracy

2.)Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction:
Extracted meaningful features (e.g., BHK, square footage, location)
Reduced irrelevant dimensions to optimize performance

3.)Model Development:
Built and trained models using Scikit-learn
Implemented Linear Regression as the primary model
Evaluated with k-fold cross-validation
Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search

4.)Web Application:
Deployed with Flask as the backend
Developed an interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Users can input details like square footage, BHK, and location to get a predicted price in real-time


ðŸš€ Tech Stack: 
Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy |
Backend: Flask |
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
An end-to-end ML pipeline and deployed web application that predicts house prices in Bangalore with an easy-to-use interface.
